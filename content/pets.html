  Companions are loyal personal allies to the Tenno. They will use their own
  unique precepts, weapons and abilities to assist their owners in their
  missions at any cost, even going so far as going directly into harms way to
  protect them. Companions are not a one-time-use ally gear like Specters, but
  rather equipped in their own slot in the user's loadout via the Arsenal. Users
  can only equip one companion at any time. A companion's stats, abilities, and
  behaviors can be upgraded and manipulated via their own set of mods. Modding
  companions is similar to modding Warframes. There are currently seven classes
  of companions: robotic Sentinels, living Kubrows and Kavats, the modular MOAs,
  the infested Predasites and Vulpaphylas, and the advanced Hounds. There are
  many differences between these classes ranging from combat and movement
  behaviors to acquisition to possible maintenance requirements. Most classes
  also have their own distinct subclasses, each with dedicated mods and other
  specifications.
