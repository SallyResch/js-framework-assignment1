Radiant starfire light our worlds ablaze. Igneous as the burning sun, Ember's fiery rage engulfs her foes and scatters their cinders in the solar wind. Empress of elemental flame, scorch the land with her wildfires. Control her fury or fuel the heat to unleash destructive incineration, leaving charred corpses and ashes adrift in her scarlet sea. Ember's flame first sparked in Vanilla and reignited in Update 26.0 (2019-10-31): The Old Blood.
