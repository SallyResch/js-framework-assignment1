Below the snowbound crust of Orb Vallis, thrives a vast subterranean undergrowth. Dwellers of the Deepmines slumber upon the fungal bedrock, where impending trouble awakens an ancient youth. Nurture this mycelial paradise where wild roots and tiny Sprodlings roam free, then frolic amongst the fungus as Nokko, the Sporespreader. Spring forth as a shrunken munchkin, regrow and rebound, until death blooms for foes who threaten our sporadic peace. Nokko sprouted in Update 40.0 (2025-10-15): The Vallis Undermind.
